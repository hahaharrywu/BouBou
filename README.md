# BouBou

BouBou is a mobile app designed for the indoor bouldering community. It helps climbers track their progress, log sends with photos and moods, and stay engaged through a social feed and leaderboard. BouBou solves the problem of scattered progress tracking and provides a dedicated space for climbers to reflect, connect with friends, and stay motivated.
